### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio website. This is the third version of my portfolio, and it's special because it's the first website I've built using **Next.js!**

#### ðŸš€ About the Project
This website showcases who I am, my projects, skills, and experiences. It's also part of my learning journey in mastering modern web development technologies â€” especially Next.js.
